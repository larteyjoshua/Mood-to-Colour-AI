HAPPY POEM

Once when I was little,
I was happy and carefree.
I used to run around laughing
Until it was time for tea.

I used to play games
And smile all the time.
I used to feel on top of the world.
I used to feel fine.

It's amazing how things change
When people let you down.
And how that once happy face
Turns into a solemn frown.

You search and search
For someone who cares,
Anyone who understands,
Anyone who dares.

Loneliness, it hurts.
It kills you deep inside.
It makes you feel empty.
It stops you in your stride.

You cry yourself to sleep,
Hugging your pillow tight,
Wishing for someone
To hold you through the night.

Once when I was little,
I was happy and carefree.
Now my life's full of sadness,
Pain and misery.

Once when I was little,
I was never on my own.
But now I pray at night,
"I wish I weren't alone."





ANGRY POEM



As I sit in my corner and think about your lies,
I have nothing else to do but break down and cry.
You knew it would end,
You knew it would die,
You knew one day we'd have to say goodbye.
You told me you loved me,
You told me you cared,
But the rage inside has slowly flared.
The moments we shared replay in my head,
Along with all the sweet lies you said.
You thought it was a game,
You thought you'd win,
But in the end you felt nothing within.
Deep down inside there was a big empty space
That I now realize you couldn't replace.
Something about you helped me see
That without love I'm finally free.
Free from pain,
Free from lies,
Free from having tear filled eyes.
Without your love I finally see
All the horrid things you've come to be.
